## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them yet, follow the instructions on [Jupyter's official website](https://jupyter.org/install).

### Prerequisites

Before you dive into the notebooks, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install all the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes all the necessary Python packages for the notebooks, such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, and more.

### Running the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
